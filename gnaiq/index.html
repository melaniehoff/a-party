    <h2>Describe the last party you particularly enjoyed. What happened there? What was the structure? Were there tickets, performances, rituals, gifts?</h2>
    <div class="what-it-is">
      <p>
        I went to a gathering for the mid-autumn festival last month.
        The party was among Chinese students in the graphic design department.
        We gathered at the host's place, who prepared plenty of dishes.
        Some of us also brought some home-cooked meals.
        I made fried rice noodles, and someone else brough home baked moon cakes.
        There were three segments to the party.
        First there was setting the tables, then there was eating and chatting, and finally it was followed by a singing, a karaoke session.

    <h3>How did you hear about this party? How were you invited?</h3>
    <div class="how-it-happened">
      <p>
        The host sent a group email to all those invited.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h3>How did this party end? How was it cleaned up after?</h3>
    <div class="how-it-ended">
      <p>
        The party ended in singing. Before everyone left, we helped clean up the dishes for the host.
