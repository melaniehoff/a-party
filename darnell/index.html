        <summary>Last Party I particularly enjoyed</summary>
        was my seventh birthday, which was a pool party. I had just learned how to swim via private lessons because i refused to let my parents to teach me. I'm not sure why i refused their help.

        <summary>What had happened was</summary>
       all my friends were there. Since my birthday was right around when the spring term concluded, i frequently had birthday's with my immediate family and occasionally my extended family. This was the first one I recall a large portion of the attendees being my friends from school and my joy at this. We didn't do much, but swim. Not that that admission is meant to deflate the fun i experienced in the act â€” simply that we swam and we had fun. I needed no other descriptors to explain an emotion so purely founded in me.

        <summary>Where the happening took place</summary>
       was my aunt's house. She had a pool and a very large house, which I recall telling everyone was a mansion because i was not familiar with existing in that much space. But despite that marvel, that i awe, i feel very odd in spaces where it takes too many steps to touch the nearest wall.

      <details>
        <summary>gifts? were there any even?</summary>
       it may sound sad if i received no gifts on my seventh birthday and i'm sure i did receieve some, but i don't think it was actively important to me. my friends being there was the greatest gift.

      <p>
        i cannot recall how the invites were disseminated. i'm absolutely sure (with no recollect) that my mom handled the invites, but it was something that flew over my head. some responsible task i had no time for. if i think about it hard enough, i can recall handing an invite to my friend, yari, and feeling excitement when she said she could come. it felt perfect.

        <marquee scrollamount="15">it ended with goodbye; it ended with all my friends in my car; with a stop for gas and we talked about the body and organs and how to explore what was inside of us, how it could grow; it ended in a lot and a bulldog and dust, so much it felt like snow; it ended with eyes closed and dutiful steps till my bed landed under me; it ended with delight and satisfaction; it ended with no worries and peace; it ended with feet on grass that i still hate feeling, this relentless crunching, these shards angry at being crushed; it ended with six being something i could never get back.</marquee>
